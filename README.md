function startTimer needs attributes:

a class of hour ('.class')
a class of minutes ('.class')
a class of seconds ('.class')
an ID of whole timer div ('id')
a deadline date in format - YYYY-MM-DD
and a not necessery time correction. in my case the desired date was always the date and 3 AM, so I just subtract 3 hours - 10800000ms.
